/* ARRAY
1- Access and output Oranges.
2- Remove the Banana from the array.
3- Sort the array in order.
4- Put "Kiwi" at the end of the array.
5- Remove "Apples" from the array.
6- Sort the array in reverse order, i.e. ['a', 'c', 'b'] becomes ['b', 'c', 'a'])
You should at the end have ["Kiwi", "Oranges", "Blueberries"]
